# Welcome to Team Foodies!

## But what is Foodies?

Foodies is a distributed system that uses Akka Actors to carry out the necessary functionalities of a food delivery system. It has 5 core services, which are user, order, restaurant, payment and delivery. Each member of our group was responsible for one of the services. A user can log-in, choose a restaurant by its ID and insert menu items into their basket, also by their IDs. Then, they can proceed with the order. Once the order is finalized, they can choose to pay by Card or Cash. This information is verified by payment service and upon successful transaction, the restaurant and the delivery services are notified of the order.

Our front-end dashboard receives live updates from the server and shows the health and status of the entire system in real-time! This was done thanks to SSE technology.
